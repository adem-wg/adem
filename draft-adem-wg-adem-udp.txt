            Serving an Authenticated Digital EMblem over UDP
                     draft-adem-wg-adem-udp-latest

Abstract

   This document describes a mechanism using the User Datagram Protocol
   (UDP) to distribute _Authenticated Digital EMblem_ (ADEM) tokens
   [ADEM-CORE].  ADEM tokens encode that an asset is protected under
   international humanitarian law.

1.  Introduction

   The ADEM Core document [ADEM-CORE] specifies how a set of _tokens_,
   encoded as JSON Web Signatures (JWSs) [RFC7515], can constitute
   _signs of protection_. Such signs of protection indicate that a
   digital asset is protected under international humanitarian law
   (IHL).  This document describes a UDP-based distribution method for
   ADEM tokens, termed ADEM-UDP.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  UDP Distribution

   Any digital, network-connected asset MAY distribute sets of ADEM
   tokens using the UDP protocol.  Whenever an asset distributes tokens
   using UDP, it MUST set the destination port to 60.  The data field
   encodes three elements (in that order): a uint16 _sequence number_, a
   uint16 stating the number of tokens in this sequence, and the token
   itself as a sequence of ASCII bytes representing the token's JWS
   compact serialization.  Any UDP packet containing an ADEM token, MUST
   contain exactly one token.  The sequence number identifies sets of
   related tokens.  Therefore, sequence numbers SHOULD NOT repeat per
   recipient IP and within 300 seconds.

   ADEM-UDP enabled assets SHOULD send a complete set of tokens allowing
   for the strongest verification possible (compare [ADEM-CORE],
   Section 6.1 (./draft-adem-wg-adem-core.html #section-6.1)) whenever a
   client attempts to connect to the respectively protected asset.
   ADEM-UDP enabled assets MUST at the same apply rate-limiting
   mechanisms when sending out tokens to the same clients.  Rate
   limitations SHOULD depend on the number of bytes sent per set of
   tokens, but assets MUST send a verifier a set of tokens at least
   every 300 seconds, should the verifier probe the protected asset
   repeatedly.

4.  UDP Parsing

   When listening on port 60, verifiers can distinguish different sets
   of tokens using the sequence number.  When receiving any token on
   port 60, verifiers MUST apply a timeout of 300 seconds.  That means,
   they MAY discard tokens from which they were not able to assemble a
   verifiable sign of protection after 300 seconds.  But at the same
   time, verifiers MUST wait for at least 300 seconds after having
   probed a protected asset until they may classify this asset as
   unprotected.

   Verifiers are RECOMMENDED to start verification procedures as
   specified in [ADEM-CORE] as soon as they received all internal
   endorsements belonging to an emblem.  Independent endorsements can be
   verified individually once they are received.

5.  Security Considerations

6.  IANA Considerations

   As per the IANA Port Number Registry [REG-PORT], port 60 is currently
   unassigned.
