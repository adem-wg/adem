            Serving an Authenticated Digital EMblem over DNS
                     draft-adem-wg-adem-dns-latest

Abstract

   This document describes a mechanism using the Domain Name System
   (DNS) to distribute _Authenticated Digital EMblem_ (ADEM) tokens
   [ADEM-CORE].  ADEM tokens encode that an asset is protected under
   international humanitarian law.

1.  Introduction

   The ADEM Core document [ADEM-CORE] specifies how a set of _tokens_,
   encoded as JSON Web Signatures (JWSs) [RFC7515], can constitute
   _signs of protection_. Such signs of protection indicate that a
   digital asset is protected under international humanitarian law
   (IHL).  This document describes a DNS-based distribution method for
   ADEM tokens, termed ADEM-DNS.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  DNS Distribution

   Given a set of tokens containing exactly one emblem and zero or more
   endorsements, a _sender_ can distribute this set via DNS [RFC1035],
   encoded as TXT records [RFC1464], as follows.

   For each such set, the sender MAY choose a unique _identifier_
   string.  If the sender distributes multiple sets of tokens for a
   given domain, a sender SHOULD choose such a string.

   Each token MUST be given a _sequence number_ (non-negative integer).
   The emblem's sequence number MUST be 0.  Beyond that, the order of
   sequence numbers must coincide with the order of endorsements.  More
   precisely, if an endorsement _A_ endorses a token _B_, _A_'s sequence
   number MUST be strictly greater than _B_'s sequence number.  There
   MAY be jumps within the sequence numbers.

   Tokens are encoded in TXT records following [RFC1464].  Consequently,
   each record includes a key and a value.  The value encodes the token
   in JWT compact serialization.  A token MAY be encoded as multiple TXT
   records should space restrictions from the DNS provider require that.
   If a token is encoded in multiple parts, each such part is given a
   unique _part number_ (non-negative integer).  Part numbers must be
   chosen order-preserving.  More precisely, if all parts of a token are
   concatenated in the order indicated by the part number (starting with
   the smallest part number), the resulting string MUST be equal to the
   original token.

   Each record's key MUST be formatted as:

   key := type [ "-" identifier ] sequence-number [ part-number ]

   type := "adem-emb" | "adem-end"

   identifier := CHARACTER-NO-HYPEN+

   sequence-number := "-s" DIGIT+

   part-number := "-p" DIGIT+

   CHARACTER-NO-HYPEN is any printable ASCII character as specified in
   [RFC0020] except for "-".  DIGIT is the range of ASCII characters "0"
   to "9". type MUST coincide with the token's "cty" claim.  If present,
   identifier MUST coincide with the string identifying the token's set.
   sequence-number MUST coincide with the token's sequence number. part-
   number MUST coincide with the respective part number.  The
   combination of identifier and the IDs -s... and -p... MUST be unique
   per domain name.

   Senders MUST ensure that only TXT records encoding an ADEM token
   start with one of the values encoded in type.

4.  DNS Querying

   To effectively query a DNS record for emblems, verifiers need to
   distinguish different sets of tokens.  In this section, we detail how
   to extract all a domain name's associated sets of tokens.

   First, a verifier MUST perform a general TXT record query for the
   domain name of question.

   Second, for each record, starting with one of the values of type, the
   verifier parses the record according to [RFC1464] and the
   specification of key.  Records for which parsing fails MUST be
   ignored.

   Third, for each emblem identified in the previous step, the verifier
   assembles a set of tokens.  Any token which either bears the same
   identifier as the emblem, or bears no identifier MUST be considered
   as belonging to that emblem's set of tokens.

   Finally, for each of these sets, the verifier can proceed to verify
   them as specified in [ADEM-CORE].
